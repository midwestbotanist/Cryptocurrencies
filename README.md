# Cryptocurrencies

## Background and Purpose:
During the Covid19 pandemic, cryptocurrencies entered the limelight as Bitcoin's worth reached up to $65k per coin at its peak in 2021. Though it just recently became so well known to the public, cryptocurrencies first began in the ideas of B-Money and Bit Gold between 1998-2009 (neither of these coins reached full development). Since Bitcoin first started to be traded in 2011, it has been the most well-known coin on the market with multiple fluctuations over time (as of January 2023, the current price is ~$20k per coin)[1].

Due to the increased public interest in cryptocurrencies, many traditional investing institutions have expanded there repertoire to include crypto options. Accountability Accounting, like many other traditional institutions, is an investment bank interested in expanding their portfolio options to include crypto. As it is new to them, Accountability Accounting has requested a report covering available coins on the market along with a classification system to group them by.

Unsupervised learning has been selected due to there being no expected output. The cryptocurrencies are being grouped through a clustering algorithm, and data visualizations will be generated.
